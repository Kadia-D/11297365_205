     The website is my version of the already existing computer science department website. It is designed to provide easy access to information needed by members of the department or prospective students. 

     It aims to connect people to the wealth of resources available in the department, and in the field of computer science as well. It contains relevant information and links to guide you to a successful computer science career.

     HOW TO CLONE AND SET UP THE PROJECT.
1. Go to GitHub and log in.
2. Click on the plus icon in the top right corner and select New Repository.
3. Give your repository a name, a description(optional) and initialize with a ReadMe.
4. Click on "Create Repository"
5. Open terminal or command prompt on your machine and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
6. Use the git clone command + the link to your repository.
7. Now, change to your project directory where you can work on and make changes to the project.
8. Periodically, stage and commit your changes using the 'git commit -m' command plus your message.
9. Finally, you can push your changes to GitHub using 'git push' command.




This project has taught me a lot of skills including, but not limited to;setting up git and github on my device. I've also learnt how to set up a repository, fork an already existing repository, and create a pull request. I now know how to commit changes in code on github.
   I've also learnt how to set up a website; from coding in html to designing in CSS.
  I've also become more familiar with git commands and their uses.

Here are screenshots of my website.
