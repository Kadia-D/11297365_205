     The website is my version of the already existing computer science department website. It is designed to provide easy access to information needed by members of the department or prospective students. 

     It aims to connect people to the wealth of resources available in the department, and in the field of computer science as well. It contains relevant information and links to guide you to a successful computer science career.
