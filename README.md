     The website is my version of the already existing computer science department website. It is designed to provide easy access to information needed by members of the department or prospective students. 

     It aims to connect people to the wealth of resources available in the department, and in the field of computer science as well. It contains relevant information and links to guide you to a successful computer science career.

     HOW TO CLONE AND SET UP THE PROJECT.




This project has taught me a lot of skills including, but not limited to;setting up git and guthub on my device. I've also learnt how to set up a repository, fork an already existing repository, and create a pull request. I now know how to commit changes in code on github.
   I've also learnt how to set up a website; from coding in html to designing in CSS.
  I've also become more familiar with hit commands and their uses.
